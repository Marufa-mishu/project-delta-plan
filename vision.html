                    Eliminate Extreme Poverty by 2030
                </b>
                <p>
                    Bangladesh has secured considerable progress in reducing the incidence of poverty, especially
                    since 2000. Both poverty and extreme poverty rates have come down sharply. The incidence of
                    extreme poverty has fallen from 34.3% in 2000 to 12.6% in 2015 (BBS 2017). 2016). The target for the
                    7 thFYP is to reduce this further to 8% by 2020. The extreme poor rely considerably on agriculture,
                    fishery and forestry for their livelihood. As such, they are highly vulnerable to changes in water,
                    climate and environmental hazards. Progress on the BDP2100 agenda will have a substantial impact
                    on further reducing poverty and eliminating extreme poverty by 2030, as stated also in the
                    Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

                    Achieve Upper Middle Income Country Status by 2030
                </b>
                <p>
                    one major goal of Vision 2021 of the government was to reach low middle income
                    status by 2021. Rapid growth since the 2000s, especially during 2010-2015, has enabled Bangladesh
                    to reach the lower of the middle income threshold as defined by the World Bank in 2015. This is a
                    remarkable achievement.  Higher GDP growth is essential to reduce poverty and mobilize the resources needed to finance investments in
                    infrastructure, human development, water resources management, as well as climate change and
                    environmental management. In turn, the reduction of the various vulnerabilities and hazards
                    associated with the Delta geography will be very important to support higher growth rates. The
                    Governmentâ€™s target is to attain upper middle income country (UMIC) status by 2030. Accordingly,
                    the BDP2100's support to helping Bangladesh reach UMIC status by 2030 would be a major long
                    term goal.
