          The Bangladesh Delta Plan (BDP) 2100 is a long term integrated techno-economic mega plan that integrates all
          delta-related sector plans and policies, enveloping a Delta Vision and strategies that make it possible to
          integrate
          sector plans and policies for the long term and to present actionable interventions with a roadmap for
          realization.
          <br>
          Government of Bangladesh has approved the Delta Plan 2100 on September 4, 2018 to secure the future of water
          resources and mitigate the likely effects of climate change and natural disasters.

                Ensure Safety from Floods and Climate Change related Disasters
            </b>
            <p>
                This goal focuses on managing the risks of floods in the wet season and other climate change
                related disasters in the Delta including the coastal zone at a well-defined and acceptable level,
                reliable water system conditions for long term economic development and the performance of
                key societal and economic functions.The goal considers ensuring safety of lives and livelihood against flood, flash
                flood, drought, salinity intrusion, river bank erosion, cyclones, storm surge, etc. through
                introducing improved adaptation and mitigation options.

            </b>
            <p>
                This goal relates to water resources management especially during the dry season as well as water
                shortage during dry spells. Maintaining a balance between the economic developments,
                expanding population and the need to secure water for multifaceted uses is a core challenge of
                the BDP 2100. The goal aims to ensure reliable and adequate provision of freshwater to support
                equitable and sustainable economic development providing sanitation at acceptable levels in relation to defined
                standards as well as environmental, health, agricultural and industrial needs.

                This goal considers sustainable management of river systems and estuaries, considered as one of
                the cornerstones of the Bangladesh Delta. The river systems of the country offer key development
                ingredients for the economy, society and the environment.This goal seeks to foster sustainable river systems management by coping with its
                morphological dynamics and results in cost-effective, environment friendly and socially viable
                options for reclamation and developments of lands.

                The goal uses the term ‘conservation’ as a more generic target to safeguard and maintain the
                wetlands, whereas ‘preservation’ is a more converging approach, to protect some sensitive
                ecosystem areas. Some of the components to be safeguarded under the goal are mangrove
                forests, water and riverine ecosystem, coastal greenbelt, seasonal and perennial wetlands, tidal
                freshwater frontier etc.

            <p>
                The goal aims to improve the existing water governance for tackling both the endogenous and
                exogenous challenges of water resources management. At the same time, the community level
                functioning of local institutions would also be rejuvenated. Key elements include: ensuring
                adequate financing for investment, operation and maintenance,private sector participation at appropriate
                levels, minimizing the gaps between planning and implementation,supporting integrated water
                resource management at regional and local levels, taking into account the interests of all

                The primary quest of this goal is to ensure efficient integration and proper interaction between
                land and water use aspects. The goal would mainstream the inter-connected resources functions
                (drainage, navigation, etc.) as well. The key topics covered by the goal are land use, water use,
                and river transport network. Establishment of connectivity of water courses and inducing integration
                between different modes of resources interactions are emphasized under this goal.
